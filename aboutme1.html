    <p class="p">Hi, my name is Jack Nelson! I am a student athlete and play both lacrosse and football. Outside of school, I like to go to the beach, hangout with friends, and take joy rides around my home town of piedmont. To expand on this, I really injoy watching new ,obies, watching the sunset and also going out at night.
      Something interesting and unique about me is that I have lived in three different countires. These include the U.S, Thailand, and Canada. This gave me the oppertunity to expereince new cultures and people around the world. These extrodaniery experiences carved me into the perosn I am today.</p>
