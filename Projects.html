    <p class="p">At school, I do a varity of projects. One of my favorites was my presentation for APSCP. For this prject were given the task to chice a AI product or technology to reaserch. Afer resserch, the final task was to make a slideshow presentation and present it your fellow classmates. I choose self driving cars, I really injoyed working on tis project beause I had the freedomm to pick any AI topic I wanted and it made it extremly interesting and engaging to work on.

    <p> Another project that I really enjoyed was outside of school, for this I replaced the front bumper of my jeep with a new one and a winch. This project took hours to complete but it was worth it and very fun and meaningfull in the process. I worked on it with my dad which added to the impact of this project.  </p>
